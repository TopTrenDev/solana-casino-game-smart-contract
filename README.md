# 🎰 Solana Casino Games – Smart Contract Suite

A **production‑grade collection of Solana casino game smart contracts**, built with **Anchor** and designed for **fairness, security, and composability**.

This repository contains multiple on‑chain casino games such as **Plinko, Jackpot, Coinflip, Dice, and Roulette**, written in Rust and optimized for real‑world deployment on Solana.

Whether you're building a full casino platform, experimenting with on‑chain randomness, or learning advanced Solana patterns (PDAs, CPI, VRF, escrow, vaults), this repo is designed to be a strong foundation.

## 🎲 Randomness Strategy

This repo is designed to support **secure randomness**, including:

- ⚠️ Pseudo‑random fallback (for local testing)
- 🔮 **VRF integration ready** (e.g. Orao, Switchboard)
- ⛓ Seed‑based entropy using blockhash + user input (non‑VRF modes)

> **Important:** For mainnet deployment, **VRF is strongly recommended** to prevent manipulation.

---

## 💰 Betting & Payout Flow

1. Player submits bet + parameters
2. Funds transferred to game vault PDA
3. Random outcome is generated
4. Win/loss is calculated on‑chain
5. Payout (if any) sent back to player
6. House edge retained in treasury

All calculations are performed **fully on‑chain**.

---

## 🔐 Security Notes

- ✔ Checked arithmetic (no overflows)
- ✔ PDA‑only vault ownership
- ✔ Explicit signer checks
- ✔ Configurable max bet & limits

> ⚠️ **This repo has not been audited.** Use at your own risk for mainnet deployments.

## 🧩 Extending the Repo

You can easily add new games by:

1. Creating a new Anchor program
2. Reusing the shared vault & randomness utilities
3. Defining game‑specific payout logic

Examples:

- Blackjack
- Baccarat
- Crash game
- Slots
