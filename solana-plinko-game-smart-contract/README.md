# Solana Plinko Game Smart Contract

This project implements a **Plinko** game smart contract on the **Solana** blockchain using Anchor framework. Players drop balls into a Plinko board, and rewards are determined based on the landing bucket. The game integrates randomness via the Orao VRF Oracle to ensure fairness and transparency.

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Start a game

The player calls play_game, placing a bet and specifying parameters (e.g., number of balls).

- Request randomness

The contract makes a request to Orao VRF.

- Fulfill randomness

Orao VRF provides random numbers; the contract processes them via fulfill_random_words.

- Determine payouts

Based on bucket indexes, payouts are computed and distributed between player and house.

- Update stats

Game, house, and user statistics are updated on-chain.
